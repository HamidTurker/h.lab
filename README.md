# h.lab

h.lab is an R package in development by me (Hamid Turker) to, eventually, form a codebase that can quickly run and reproduce any analyses of interest that cannot easily be run in base R or through other widely utilized R packages.

Although many of these functions are already finished and in use, this project is still very much in its early days.

For the Matlab versions of these scripts, check the h_lab repo.
